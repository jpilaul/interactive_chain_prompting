We've run every ancient systems diagnostic we've got. - Nothing. - Rush is trying to write a new program, but it seems like this thing is designed to prevent any kind of access except through the chair itself. - Which would prevent an alien species who doesn't happen to share ancient physiology from trying to hack in, I guess. - Maybe Rush is right.

We know that a large portion of the prison population in France suffers from such destitution that they have to engage in prostitution to get enough money to buy soap to wash themselves, to wash their clothes and their dishes. - The other reason is that incarceration is very often a heavy financial burden on the families of inmates, who generally come from the most deprived strata. - So it would help lift a heavy economic burden on families which are, as it were, being penalised, although they have committed no crime. - And the last reason, a symbolic one, seems to me to suffice in itself. - To grant this benefit to an inmate, who is entitled to it on the outside, is to express that he continues to be part of the civic community, that he hasn't been excluded from society.	 
It was great.	Sehr schön.	- Be wary of shy. - They rule the world. - Even so, I will arrange dinner - But without you, Jean. - A 32.

Ich bin mir sicher, dass lhre technischen Fachkenntnisse bald gebraucht werden, aber bis Dr. Frasier anders entscheidet, befehle ich lhnen, sich zu entspannen.	Otherwise, you're all free to take some time off. - Dismissed. - Sir. - With all due respect, I feel fine. - There's absolutely no reason why I shouldn't help.

You should try it sometime.	Solltest du mal ausprobieren.	The Arcadian is an architecturally significant... - Architecturally significant? - ! Zoey, you're very pretty. - Your hair smells great. - Shampoo.	 
I did that once, it was great.	Oh, das habe ich auch mal getan. Es war toll.	- When is he coming? - - He is not coming. - What happened? - We just ran out of gas... - I guess I mistook sex for love.	 
I was just keeping it warm for you.	Ich hielt sie dir nur warm.	It was a wonderful hospital. - And such nurses, too. - And we were worried about this big lug. - This calls for a celebration. - He came back when he heard how good you were in the centre ring.	 
You must withdraw it spontaneously.	Zieh das Stück zurück, und zwar sofort.	You know what they say? - "Some texts can only favour our class enemies" - But how the truth could favour the enemy? - I repeat, Nikolai. - Think it over, do as I say.	 
We can talk about it later.	Wir können später darüber reden.	You got it. - Clark. - - About the date... - - It's okay. - Take your time.	 
I can't get it out of my head.	Ich kann es nicht fassen, Charlie.	I wonder what sort of telegrams we'll get when it's known that Wilson was an innocent man. - Well, when I gave out the statement I didn't know that. - This story is on every wire in the world right now. - Yeah, yeah. - Now he's innocent. Yeah.	 
I-I had something in my eye, and he was helping me get it out.	Ich hatte etwas in meinem Auge und er hat mir geholfen es raus zu bringen.	- Uh, n-no. - No, I wasn't. - When? - This morning, in the kitchen. - No, no, honey.	 
It was great.	Ach, das warwunderbar.	I got cold feet. - But Mary was a great girl. - We laughed a lot. - All day long. - You should hear her laugh.	 
Let's try it again.	Also noch mal.	- Good night. - # Ooh-ooh, Basin Street - # Boo-boo boo-boo-boo # - Well, get you! - Here.	 
We just broke up and he can't let it go.	Wir haben gerade Schluss gemacht und er kann das einfach nicht akzeptieren.	I'll tell you what I love. - The fact that we're over! - Good-bye. - - You went out with that guy? - - I used to.	 
Don't take it personally.	Nimm das nicht persönlich.	Christmas, family ... I like it! - It might be romantic. - So you'll give me a ride? No, I can't do that. - But good luck. - I'd love to help you, but ...	 
Well, I-I like young women... - let's put it this way... - and I think most of men do, actually.	Also, ich... ich liebe junge Frauen... - lassen Sie es mich so sagen... - und ich denke, die meisten Männer tun das auch.	I hope you don't mind if I just reach across here and grab a couple of these... - of these nuts. - I will too. - Anyway, that's... - that's fiction. - And I think this probably may be still in the land of fiction, edging towards fact. - When the... - when the newspapers and the magazines and the books talk about you and little girls, is there anything in it?	 
I'm trying to figure it out.	Ich versuche es herauszubekommen.	Say a big swell hits Hawaii, and you ride one of those huge waves. - The wave folds back together on the other side of the island. - Then back out across the ocean, to wherever it needs to go. - All you would need to do to ride it again, is find out where it's heading, and beat it there, however you can. - That's what I've been doing.	 
We'd probably have to cut it open.	Vielleicht müssen wir es aufschneiden.	The material, the design, it's completely different. - It's not emitting any radiation, or EM fields. - It's basically dead. - Have you been inside? - We've located what looks like a hatch, but we haven't figure out how to get in.	 
- How long will it take?	- Wie lange dauert das?	I give. - We never make Hong Kong with old iron boiler. - I plenty good engineer. - Know my stuff. - - Now repair yard give us new steel boiler.	 
it was great. She's really cool.	Sie ist wirklich cool.	And the right angle. - Death by shower. - That's a new one. - So, did everything work out with Hannah? - Yeah, yeah. It was...	 
- Yeah, you could call it that.	- So könnte man's ausdrücken,ja.	- Yeah, I'm looking for a Carl Fairbanks. - - I'm sorry, sir, but the Commissioner hasn't set up his voice mail. - May I take a message? - - We done here? - Yeah, we good. - - Found a little trouble tonight, huh, Billy?	 
You don't tell me to take it easy.	Du sagst mir nicht, dass ich mich beruhigen soll.	Can't I say "take it easy" without starting a panic? - I mean, what is going on here? - Mr Fawlty, take it easy. - Now look... - Get one thing clear, all right?	 
I think I'll keep it as a souvenir.	Den behalt ich als Souvenir. Aber...	The final hand. - What a shame. It appears I'm not skillful or lucky either. - Then what are you? - Another Blackjack. - You cleaned me out. All but this one chip.	 
Try to play it slowly first. Then the notes will follow automatically. Then you can create something.	Versuch es zuerst ganz langsam zu spielen, dann kommen die Noten von ganz allein, und ja, dann kann etwas entstehen.	Like you said: Talent is only half of it. - The rest is just practice. - With emotion, Belle. - Try to feel the piece. - Let yourself go.	 
I've tried to fix it, but I can't get it to work.	- Ich kann es nicht reparieren.	I inherited it from my mother. - I'II never sell it. - Listen to it for a while, and I'II be right back. - Do you listen to the radio? - No, ours is broken all the time.	 
But, you know, I... look, I don't take it personally.	Aber weißt du, i..., nimm es nicht persönlich.	Now, hold on. - Whoa, whoops. - Sorry about that. - Here we go. - Hey, I'm just glad I could be here. To, you know, help rescue a woman I've never met before. Or been introduced to.	 
You should try it sometime.	Solltest du auch mal probieren.	But you have been pestering him... - Yeah... just a little difference of opinion. - Thanks for the ticket. - What was worth getting in such a rage about? - Just had to let off some steam.	 
I'm gonna go check it out.	Ich werde mir das anschauen.	Hey. - Everything okay? - Yeah. - That's Parker. - Okay.	 
So let's keep it that way.	Also belassen wir es auch dabei.	Um, you know what I mean. - Can you say why America is the greatest country in the world? - Diversity and opportunity. - Lewis. - Freedom and freedom.

Uhh! I have to put it back.	Ich muss es wieder zurücksetzen.	Come on. - - Come on. - I'm still here. - You were right, Jack. - Yeah, well... there's a first time for everything.	 
Well, I'll try not to hold it against you.	Gut, ich werde versuchen, Ihnen das nachzusehen.	You're going to stay in one place from now on? - Sergeant Green. - Marine Corps? - Ah, hell, no. - Army Rangers.	 
It could kill her, Jack.	Es könnte sie töten, Jack.	DOCTOR: - It's going to be next to impossible to communicate with her in the near term unless we essentially attempt to shock her out of this state. - Mike... will they let me speak to Audrey? - The shrink who's treating her doesn't think it's a good idea. - And he's about to try some protocol of his own using big doses of drugs.	 
Put it back.	Stell es wieder hin.	Who are you? - Stroud. - You're lucky to be in this cellblock. - Boss here's a friend of mine. - Picture of your mother?	 
If all goes to plan, we can talk about it later.	Wenn es planmäßig läuft, können wir später darüber reden.	Well, at least we have the vaccine Two Horns wants. - We're almost done. - "Almost" and "done," not the same thing. - Yeah, but when we are done... then no more work for the city's slimiest crime boss, right? - I mean, if all goes to plan.

And we're going to have to tow it over, I guess.	Und wir müssten es rüberschleppen.	And it'll be 50 for labor. - That's the best you'll find. - I promise that. - Okay. And what about a timing belt? How much is that? - Could be a little bit more, but I won't know until I have a look.	 
You can't bring it into the light... not yet!	Sie dürfen es nicht ans Licht bringen... noch nicht!	The child I'm carrying, it isn't Bajoran... it's human. - It has unique medical needs. - If you force me to give birth now, you risk... - The creature's cries grow louder but no one can hear them. - All that remains is to bring the child into the light and discard the diseased carcass of the mother before it can infect its offspring.

But by the same token, it means everything.	Aber es bedeutet auch alles.	Reverse thrusters, full impulse. - Captain's Log, Stardate 53301.2. - The away team collected over 60 teraquads of data on the anomaly. - Before we begin to analyze them, we've decided to pay our respects to an old colleague. - Space... literally, it means "nothing"... a vacuum between stars and planets.	 
You can't take it personally.	-Nehmen Sie das nicht persönlich!	Gentlemen!

I am trying to get to know you, but you're doing everything you can to avoid me! - That's because you're stiff, you're humorless, you're a control freak. - You operate from this place of fear. - You know... - My mom used to tell me every day that she loved me.	 
I know, because I had to look it up.	Ich weiß das, weil ich es nachgeprüft habe.	Come on, Jamie. - Don't take us for fools. - I've been editing your copy for two years now. - And you've used the word "pettifoggery" - on several occasions.	 
You have to bring it back.	Man muss es auch zurückbringen.	The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. - Now you're looking for the secret, but you won't find it, because, of course, you're not really looking. - You don't really want to know. - You want to be... fooled. - But you wouldn't clap yet, because making something disappear isn't enough.	 
But I worry about how to put it up there.	Aber wie sollen wir es dort oben hinbekommen?	No! Koy! - Oh! - Stop! - Stop forbidding me to do anything. - I will consult with my father and Uncle Tup about the gunpowder.

The mere memory of it leaves me shamed.	Allein die Erinnerung daran beschämt mich.	I am not sure what you mean, Sir, nor am I sure I want to. - Allow me to put your fears to rest. - I wish to apologize. - That awful day in the woods... - Who are you?	 
Get it out and put it on the table right now!	Holt es raus und legt es auf den Tisch!	Get on your knees! - All right. - What's your name? Max. - Max is my little fucking dog. - Everybody get your fucking money and he's gonna go fetch.

Her skull was intact, so it made it easy to work with.	Ihr Schädel war ganz, das macht es leichter.	Well, I hope it's not soup. - If she was his student and I'm her student, then it follows... - Ain't gonna happen, Zack-O. - Not in this universe. - Here's a sketch of the victim.	 
Spit it out...	Spuck's aus!	I could hardly sneak out on my wife. - I'm not paying your pad so that you can go to the disco. - Are you doing this on purpose? - Are you doing this on purpose... - Maya?	 
Keep it safe.	Verwahre es in Sicherheit.	Take it. - - No... - Don't let anybody know that you have it. - If anything happens to me, just do what I told you. - Stay off the road, they're gonna be looking for it.

What's it about?	Worüber?	What are you doing here, or are you just with them? - I hear you're a writer. - - Your mother says you wrote a book. - Yeah. - Then not sort of, you're a writer.	 
Let me put it this way: if you think you know the answer and because of that, you think you're better than everybody else, then you're guilty of it.	Wenn du denkst, du kennst die Antwort und hältst dich deshalb für was Besseres, dann bist du dessen schuldig.	Gluttony, sure. - Greed, yeah. - Envy, sloth, anger-- Or to be a little more technical, wrath. - What else? - What else?	 
Use it to dig into our past, Regina.	Benutze ihn, um in unserer Vergangenheit zu graben, Regina.	Oh, well, you shouldn't. - It's a lot to swallow, which is why I've brought a gift to help. - I don't want a gift from you. - Oh, but you shall have it. - You see, my gift to you is this sad, sad day.

What if we try touching it at the same time?	Was, wenn wir versuchen, sie alle zugleich zu berühren?	Then how do we make this right? - We got to win over their hearts and minds. - - Still nothing. - - The dome kind of has a mind of its own. - Maybe it's not in the mood.	 
I, uh... just wanted to stop by and tell you I don't take it personally.	Ich... wollte nur anhalten und Ihnen sagen, dass ich es nicht persönlich nehme.	I, uh... - looked up your address. - Actually easier to get than your phone number, believe it or not. - Oh, did you want to come in or... - No, actually, I'm on duty.	 
It can store the food for eventual recycling. Eh... maybe we should focus on something more productive, like getting out of here.	Wir sollten etwas Konstruktiveres ins Auge fassen, wie hier abzuhauen.	My uniform probably tastes better. You know, I was thinking. When we get back to Voyager, perhaps you and Seven could help me modify my physical parameters. - Why? - So I can eat, of course, like any other member of the crew. - There's just one small problem-- you don't have a stomach. - Where is the food gonna go? I believe we can construct a holographic stomach.	 
You should try it sometime.	Damit solltest du es auch mal versuchen.	I can't believe you. - I don't believe you. - You don't believe you. - Fuck it. - Helen is courteous.

Anyone understand him? - I think that what we have right about here is how about telling them about your very first big hit, "Love Me Do". - Does that record have your present day sound, the start of it? - That was the start of it. - After that we never looked back.	 
So you can talk it over and decide.	So könnt ich darüber reden und euch entscheiden.	Yes,and who's eating on that dinette set now? - That's not the point. - Charlie's marriage is just as likely to fail as mine was. - Thanks again,bro. - Anyway,I asked them to hold the date for 24 hours.
