- Set it up from the outside.	Leurrez-les de l'extérieur.	I like that! - We have information they don't have. - That's how you take somebody out. - Wait a minute. Won't they see the sun's still out? - - You'll have to take care of that. - Me?	 
I think it might be worth putting her under surveillance.	Je pense que ça ne serait pas plus mal de la garder à l'oeil.	We're working up their new identities now. - She hasn't asked to visit her parents or some other relative, has she? - No. - Why? - Nothing.	 
And shake it up a little bit with the riff-raff.	Et la remuer un peu avec l'aide de la racaille.	Danielle Steel. - - Ethan Hawke. - - Judy Blume. - Exactly. - I can wallow in the harsh under belly of prison life.	 
I wish I could take it back.	J'aimerais revenir en arrière.	I don't know what happened, haddie. - Uh, it was an accident. - I, I messed up. - I, I was drinking and he was being nice, and I just-- something is wrong with me. - I'm sorry.	 
I mean, I can't leave it hanging around, can I?	Je ne peux le laisser en suspens.	Only scumbags run away. - You can't trust someone who does that, can you? - I mean, would you trust them, Tom? Would you? - No, no, I wouldn't. - So you see why this is a problem I have to deal with, don't you?	 
Well, I like to think of it more as... Sanctuary.	Je le vois plus comme... un refuge.	You did. - Then why am I here, Ms. Johnson? - You have spent a lot of time protecting people who have done very bad things. - Now they have a chance to step up and protect you. - So, basically, you're holding me hostage.	 
-What's it about?	- Sur quoi ?	-You'II feel better after you eat. - -If I want to eat, I'II make it. I can cook. - only in the microwave. - Madison's really cooking. - -Whatever. I got a paper to write.	 
Then what's it about?	Alors de quoi s'agit-il ?	I'm persona non grata at the moment. - What about the assistant director? - Callen and Sam are on that sub, sir. - I'm well aware of that, Blye. - I will do anything to get my people back, but this isn't about them.	 
I'll put it back.	Je la remet.	"I live with someone I don't trust". - - What do you mean, "trust"? - Mean? - We live together. - Look what you're doing to my life.	 
The least we can do is check it out.	On doit au moins vérifier.	Just be glad you're on the right side of things. - Look, I know this is the right address, but you're sure this place is it? - Shouldn't there be guards everywhere? Not if they want to keep it under the radar. - There's no cameras either. - Michael went through a lot of trouble to get this intel.	 
I never could get it right, though.	Je n'y arrivais pas.	Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - It's a lovely day. - Hi, nice to meet you. - It's a lovely day.	 
We can work it out...	On peut s'arranger, non ?	- It runs in the family, pal. - - Daniel, you've been shafted up to the hilt. - You owe me 200. - Very classy. - English public school style? - C'mon, Caro.	 
When you do, can you wrap it for me?	Quand tu le feras, tu pourras me l'envelopper ?	You know what? - You used to be a much better liar. - Nice tie. - Thanks. - I can't wait to take it off.	 
Let me put it this way. Are you familiar with mass hysteria?	Dit d'une autre manière, savez-vous ce qu'est l'hystérie collective ?	Hey, Billy. - Tell me something. Do you really buy into all this spirit in the house stuff, you know? - No, I do not. Buy it. - I know such stories are around, but while I'm here. Let me ask you. - Have either of you gentlemen ... ever witnessed first hand a verifiable paranormal event.	 
Well, you can't take it personally.	Eh bien, tu ne peux pas le prendre personnellement.	All right. Talk to me, girlfriend. - Tell me what's on your mind. - Do you find it odd that Alexis has gone. To everyone but me on this case? - She hasn't gone to perlmutter yet. - Yeah, well, no one does if they can help it.	 
Life is not worth living unless you find someone to share it with.	La vie ne vaut pas d'être vécu si vous ne trouvez pas quelqu'un avec qui la partager.	Love is what brings two people together. - ♪ Oh, I'm afraid ♪ - ♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪ - ♪ somebody found me here ♪ - ♪ ah, ah, ah ♪	 
Maybe I can use it to get back.	Je peux peut-être l'emprunter.	We only know that an accident occurred. - We don't know how or why. - Well, that's not good enough. - There's got to be something we can do. - Where is this time-stream of yours?	 
Okay, let's try it again.	Ok, on essaie encore.	Try it again, okay? - You can't mess up, okay? - Ready? - This way. - One, two, three...	 
It didn't move like it was supposed to.	Il ne s'est pas propagé comme il était censé le faire.	Kessler-- Him and his wife. - How? - After we got back, I was crashing on their couch for a while. - And this one night, I woke up and their house was on fire. - JeMarcus and Lana were trapped down a hall. I tried to get to them, but the fire moved.	 
You're looking at a week. If not, we can bust it up.	Sinon, on le fait sauter.	It's the beaver dam. It's a good one, too. - It's blocking the drainage about 30 yards in. - How long's that gonna set us back? - - There we go. - Back. - Well, you want me to keep the beaver dam?	 
You can have it as soon as he leaves though.	Je te la rends dès qu'il sera parti.	This way. - Hello, Gus. - Got my room ready for me? - Well, if it isn't 'Sailor Boy' Hansen. - I'm sorry, but they put a guest in your room for the weekend.	 
So what's it about?	Et ça... parle de quoi ?	How about you come up? - Oh,my god. - Want some? - No,thanks. - I'm workingon a triptych.	 
And I haven't heard you say it once.	Et je ne t'ai pas entendu le dire une fois.	I am trying to get to know you, but you're doing everything you can to avoid me! - That's because you're stiff, you're humorless, you're a control freak. - You operate from this place of fear. - You know... - My mom used to tell me every day that she loved me.	 
- It was great.	- C'était génial.	- Sure, I do. - Well, you see, they made a choice. - Anthony and Gail made a choice to stay on Baronne Street and keep their hands on what they were serving. - They cooked. - Every day they cooked until they could cook no more.	 
But... well, put it this way...	Mais... bon, vu comme ça...	Course it bothers me! - I'm not stupid! - There's not a lot we can do about that, is there? - Look, I know it's not an ideal situation. - Anything but.	 
Maybe it'll help us find it.	Peut-être que cela nous aidera à la trouver.	What if this thing is still after her? - We don't know anything about it, Nathan. - I think we need to reconsider our deal with The Darkside Seekers. - You made a deal with those little weasels? - No, not yet, but they have footage of this thing.	 
It breaks my heart to see her in that place, but she is strong.	Ça me brise le coeur de la voir là, mais elle est forte.	== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man - Come on. Move along. - This way. Downstairs. - I hope everything will be resolved while we're away. - How is she?	 
Leslie Chow. He's an international criminal. Look it up.	Leslie Chow, criminel international.	Is this record accurate? - I did that. - Masturbating on a city bus. Yep, that was me. - Look, we've been here for 5 hours. We already told your guys everything. - You told them a story about a little Chinese man.	 
I could make it disappear.	Je pourrais le faire disparaître.	But I was backed into a corner... - I was just pissed off at being manipulated, sir. - If you need my help, just ask. - As Buckells goes through Jackie's finances... there's going to be a link to you, isn't there? - No, there's not.	 
He thought I'd tried to steal it or something.	Il pensait qu'essayais de le voler ou quelque chose comme ça.	Where did you get this? - Graham. - Police technicians were able to enhance the audio so we could discern some of what Titus was saying. - As far as we can make out, someone had attempted to access his tablet without his permission and he was upset about it. - He was crazy that day.	 
Okay, you don't have to read it out loud.	Ok. Ne lis pas à haute voix.	- Ohh! Hey. - - Sir, I need you to hold still. - - Ow! - "Rule number 3... do not talk to your ex for 60 days." - Ooh, well, good thing you guys don't work together.	 
And what's it about?	Et ça parle de quoi?	- Don't know. - - Have you been writing? - - Something. Yes. - How odd, at night. - I was sitting here. It got late.	 
- How long will it take? - About an hour and a half.	- Combien de temps ça prendra?	I was told he's a family member. - - Is that wrong? - - He's from my father's family! - He's my enemy! Enemy! - Enemy!	 
Well, there's no harm in checking it out.	- Il n'y a pas de mal à se renseigner.	How cool was that? - Well, she said there was treatment, though, right? - Yeah, "somewhat invasive". - That's code, Danny, for - "This ain't gonna be pretty".	 
It was great.	Elle était délicieuse.	Get out of the car. - I didn't get any. - Kelly, get back in the car. - Bud, did you get ice cream? - Yeah, Kel.	 
Maybe she read it to her dad and he thought it was great.	Peut-être qu'elle a lu à son père et qu'il a trouvé ça bien.	Schatzhauser... lives. - He took off..." - Lara, that was your homework. - Didn't you practice reading? - Didn't you have time?	 
He said you guys used to watch it together, so...	Il a dit que vous la regardiez ensemble alors ..	Look at this. - How'd you know? - This was before you were born. - You know, the gift isn't from me. - It's from dad.	 
How long will it take?	- Ça va prendre longtemps ?	We have several thousand persons of interest on our files, Arkady, but I thank you for the alert. - You know I might like to access your files on this one. - Perhaps... - if you find yourself of a mind. - The oil deal, between our two countries. You might wish to... butter the wheels a little.	 
I can't just magically hand it over.	Je ne peux pas te l'accorder comme ça.	Look, there are things that you don't know, ok? - Things that I want to tell you, but I can't. - And I may never be able to. - And I just need you to trust me. - Trust is earned.	 
Why do you wanna waste it like that? Shut Up...	Pourquoi tu gaspilles comme ça ?	That's a stupid question. - Hurry up Casanova it's Jack's turn... Jack's next... - OK Jack... Go ahead... - Come on .. - We only have three cans of film left, we can't use this...	 
No, but we can work it out. It's no problem.	- Non, mais pour ça, on s'arrangera.	That sum will only cover the renovation costs? No. - It also covers equipment, kitchen, decor, tables, chairs. - All that. - How about operating costs? How will you cover that? - Have you thought about start-up funds?	 
It was great.	Super.	When you're hot... you're hot. - - It's okay to laugh. - - No, it isn't. - - It isn't hip. - It turns me on, darling. - So how was your day?	 
Owen used to visit it when he was a boy.	Owen y allait quand il était enfant.	This is control, DCI Luther. - What is your status, over? - I'm en route to the Kings Hill Estate, over. - Please clarify, over. - There's a flat there that belonged to one of Terry Lynch's old pals.	 
He can spot it a mile away.	Il peut la repérer à un kilomètre à la ronde.	Joe, this man is evil in the most unimaginable ways. - Because he looks so benign. - Because he looks so friendly, so nice. - And not only that. - He has a kind of radar for innocence.	 
Yes, but that was to make it possible for you to steal it.	Oui, mais c'était pour que vous puissiez la voler.	Put your hands there. - Ms. Vabar, what are you doing here? - I came for that. - And how much are you willing to pay for it, Ms. Vabar? - You've already been paid.	 
I had to hide it from the kids.	J'ai dû cacher les enfants d'elle.	She would come home stinking! - You know, I helped her to be sick. I would help her. - I fucking- - - I undressed her. - I put her in bed, and I would call the school the next day making up excuses.	 
I want to take it easy.	Je veux rester tranquille.	- I didn't sign. - And, just between us, that's not the issue. - - You don't want to play Berlusconi? - - I've never backed down from anything. - Allende, Vietnam, the struggles for actors with Gian Maria...	 
But we need to find her before it gets dark.	Il faut la trouver avant la nuit.	That's why I tried to warn her. - I have to find her. - I have to find Ellie. - Well, I mean, chances are she's probably still in the area. - It's too risky to move her during daylight.	 
Is it important?	C'est important?	There's something I want you to check. - Can't Doc Perkins do it? - I don't want to destroy his confidence. - Yeah, but State Homicide operates on a budget. - This stuff costs money.	 
We planned it around my doctor visit.	Nous pensions le faire durant ma visite médicale.	I couldn't live like that... Shut away, afraid even to speak. - That's not a life. - - Tell me what happened the other day. - - Oh, my god. - Oh, my god.	 
Most likely they'll have to put it down.	Ils l'abattront probablement.	We're not leaving without it. - Without what? - A couple of students said they saw it running across the field and back into the woods. - Thank God, nobody got hurt. - What happens if she does hurt someone?	 
But you said it was great. It was.it was.	Mais c'était génial.	When I went back to visit molly... um, about a year and a half ago... we went to a party that some of her friends were having in this crazy loft thing. - And, um, I had a lot to drink... and I made out with somebody in the bathroom. - And it was great. - I-- I was so happy to come home after that. - I just knew what I was coming home to, you know? And I knew what I wanted.	 
We can't close it from here, either. There's something wrong with the mechanism.	Impossible de la fermer d'ici non plus.	- GREER: Shut up, Franklin. - I'm just saying what everyone's got to be thinking. - I said shut up, or else you're going to be the first. - Yeah, yeah, that's it. Can you close it? - It won't close.	 
We need to get it in before Monday.	Je remplis le formulaire pour ta bourse. Il faut le renvoyer avant lundi.	_ - You're not sleeping enough. - It helps. All the books say it helps. - Mm-hmm. - What are you doing? Filling out your financial-aid form.

I told my dad that I was coming here to change my passive-aggressive behavior and he said, "While you're there, can you work on not being gay?" - Okay. - Did you handle that in a healthy way or with a passive-aggressive act? - I sent everyone in my family a Fourth of July card with a picture of me dressed as the Statue of Liberty with a sparkler sticking out of my ass. - Patrick, that's not a passive-aggressive act, it's the whole play.	 
Are you certain you want to use it now?	Vous êtes certain de vouloir l'utiliser maintenant ?	Direct hit. - Shall we commence our Goose hunt? - not yet. - Send one more their way. - There's only one panzerfaust left.	 
Try it and see what happens.	Essayez-le et voyez ce qui se passe.	Oh, I don't want to go down that road. - I remember on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, - Mary had insomnia and then she got addicted to sleeping pills. - Well, science has made great strides since the fictional 1970s. - Look, if you want, I'll have my partner write a prescription for you.	 
I can't get it out of my head.	Je n'arrive pas à me le sortir de la tête.	Leave her alone. - You know that's my friend. - Mm-hmm, your friend that has everything to say about everything. - Yas doing all right after that thing the other night? - Yas has forgotten about it, of course.	 
I couldn't have done it without you.	Je n'y serais pas arrivé sans vous.

We made love for the first time last night, And it was great.	On a fait l'amour pour la 1re fois hier, c'était super.	- Around 7? - What are you doing here? - Why aren't you with grace? - She doesn't want me there and i didn't feel like being home alone. - What am i gonna do?	 
-He says, "We'll take it from here."	- Il nous a dit : "On s'en occupe."	Maybe. - We never got the chance to go further. - Why not? - We went to your Deputy for Operations and told him what we had. - -You took it to Burrell?	 
It was great.	C'était très bien.	Nili, what happened in high school? - I don't know... I don't know... - I want my baby, give me my baby! - No, it's not right. I can't run. - Why not?	 
And let's keep it that way.	Et continuons sur cette voie.	Arroyo feels guilty. - And as much as I hate to admit it... he made this case-- he's a good detective. - He's a damn good detective. - You must've made a hell of a team before things went sour between you two. - Like us.	 
Oh, it wasn't a secret, which I wouldn't have been able to keep anyway.	Oh, ce n'était pas un secret, secret que je n'aurais pas été capable de garder de toute manière.	You only come around when you need a kill tutorial. - It's him or me, Stevie. - Just make sure you're ready to ring that bell, because you can't un-ring it. - So, you and Nora busted up. - You told her th-- Of course you told her.	 
It was great.	C'était super.	But Gibbs had your phone? Yeah. - I left it in the diner last night. - He said he'd leave it here and I could pick it up. - Sorry I made you sit through dinner. - Oh, no, don't be.	 
Weiss says that I have to produce it for evidence.	Weiss dit que je doit le fournir comme preuve.	Oh, no. - It's okay. - I brought my own I.T. - Daniel. - I didn't know keeping the recording was gonna be such a big issue, but now that the existence of the recording is part of my deposition,	 
- I haven't figured it out yet.	- Je ne sais pas.	- I do mechanics for magazines... - - Yeah, yeah. I know what that shit is. - - There's something about you. - - About me? - - Good or bad?	 
Well let's put it this way. If you start singing, it's all over.	Pour le dire autrement : si tu commences à chanter, c'est trop tard.	A little... hardy. I mean... robust. - I mean... - - Fat. - Fat? - I've become fat?	 
I know I fucked this up right from the get... but I'm gonna do everything I can to make it right.	Je sais que j'ai merdé. Je ferai tout pour me faire pardonner...	It's Just more of the same for me. - Just more of the same. - You fellas are on a real busman's holiday, aren't ya? - Hey, look at you. You roll into town with more guys than Sinatra, right? - Teddy, I Just want you to know how truly sorry I am.	 
We could make it permanent.	On pourrait officialiser ça.	Got to get out of here. - My house tomorrow? - what are wedoing,paula? - Living. - Yeah.

Thank you. - You see this? - He cut the screen around the edge from right to left, nice and square, and he climbed in over that counter.	 
He didn't have time to have it made.	Il n'a pas eu le temps de la fabriquer.	He never left. - Where did he get the case? - It's a case for ice skates. - Why ice skates? - And why would Gregor know an ice skate case?	 
It was the only way to protect her.	C'était le seul moyen de la protéger.	Great, this lobster dish, perfect. - Wait till you sample her couscous. - By the way, there's one thing you never explained to me. - The bread. Why didn't you give it to Martine? - Because I like her too much.

I thought it was great. Remember, I went there every day for a month and then, when you told me I couldn't go back, I tried to kill you.	Souviens-toi, j'y suis allé pendant un mois, et quand t'as voulu m'en empêcher, j'ai essayé de te tuer.	Man, I haven't seen a line this long in Camden since the opening day of the methadone clinic. - That place was a rip-off. - Me and Randy waited in line for two hours and all we got was a cup of weird tasting orange juice. - Really, Earl? - You didn't like it?	 
There's a way we can do it clean.	Y a une façon de faire ça sans se mouiller.	Que vato. - Santana, watch your back. - If we show weakness now, homes, everybody's gonna see it. - Not just the mayates and wops, but the Nuestra Familia as well. - They're just waiting to make their fucking move.	 
Still, I'd like to get it from you...	J'aimerais l'avoir par vous...	Are you the lady who made the cure? - Can I get it? - Well, weren't you in the park earlier? - No. I missed the party. - Well, with so many people exposed, it's likely you caught it just walking into the hotel.

Well, she has no reason whatsoever not to use it on me.	Bon, elle n'a pas de raison cependant de ne pas l'utiliser sur moi.	Where are you going? - I'm going to find the witch. - Seems I need to educate her as to what she may or may not do in my city. - The stake is safe. - Davina won't use it on Klaus if it would kill me.

Where's it going?	Où est-ce qu'il va ?	Don't pinch it! - Where's it going? - Where does it fly to? - Where indeed? - I want to touch it.	 
We'll keep it safe.	Nous le garderons en sécurité.	All you have to do is arrest him. - You'll find the stolen painting in the trunk. - No drama, no high-speed chase, no risk. - Okay, but do not engage. - We don't want to endanger the public.	 
Well, let's try and get it open, shall we?	Bon, on essaie de l'ouvrir?
