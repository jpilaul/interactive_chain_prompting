But it was also sort of fiction and maybe a creative outlet for my fucking head. - What I've been doing on the last two albums is what should drive people to suicide. - And it's really taking out the strength, right?	Because you can't really get strength from the lyrics on the last two albums, while you probably could from an album like "A Blaze In The Northern Sky."	Aus den Texten der letzten beiden Alben kann man keine Kräfte schöpfen. Bei "A Blaze ln the Northern Sky" könnte man das.

I'll buy you a cowboy suit and a set of trains. - I want you to take a long last look at the blue sky, the green grass... the trees and the river, all of which I loathe personally... which is why a juicy stretch in a cozy French prison... doesn't bother me at all. - You think you have a scheme that might work? - You really are the smuggest and most hateful man.	If you frequent criminal circles, you can't be choosey.	Wenn man mit Kriminellen verkehrt, darf man nicht wählerisch sein.
neutral	 	In the past, maybe. - But no one travels 1000 km here today. - Didn't Veli and Hamdullah Hodja come here from Istanbul? - That was different.

So if you like to travel and you love to eat, as I do, you have to find a way to pay for it somehow.	Also, wenn man gerne reist und man es liebt zu essen, wie ich es tue, dann muss man einen Weg finden, um das irgendwie zu bezahlen.

formal	 	Me underwear's on fire! - I'm on fire! - Oh, yeah. - And now, Eugene Krabs, you will... - Wait.	I'm flattered you would do this on my account, but being manager isn't worth killing Mr. Krabs over.	Ich bin geschmeichelt, dass Ihr das meinetwegen tun würdet, aber der Managerposten ist es nicht wert, Mr. Krabs zu töten.
formal	 	- For example, what if he were adopted by uh, well, you know, - wolves? - Wolves would probably eat him alive. - - Which is something I would never do. - - Right. No, of course not.	Adrian, I know you don't want to hear this.	Adrian, es ist mir klar, dass Sie das nicht hören wollen...
formal	 	Is that our men? Why have they stopped? - Why have you stopped? Why aren't you still chasing them? - Have you lost your senses? - Do you want to be stripped of your rank? - Do you want to be thrown into the dungeon?	Do you want to dance?	Wollen Sie tanzen?
formal	 	Bianca. - Bianca, darling. - I have been waiting hours. - - Oh, really? - How nice.	- Are you busy now?	- Sind Sie beschäftigt?

Tom, you got access no one else has.	Tom, Sie haben Zugang wie sonst niemand.
formal	 	387 that need to be pared down to a final crew of 20. - Maybe I'll just evaluate the tech side while you ask the questions. - Splendid idea. - Dr. Fargo, you're looking rather dapper today. - - Parrish, that was...	- The tie you've picked out almost makes your head look normal-sized.	- Die Krawatte, die sie ausgesucht haben,... lässt Ihren Kopf fast in normaler Größe aussehen.

Also diese Analysten, von denen Sie sprechen, sie machen Vorhersagen über Dunbars Bericht, der noch nicht mal veröffentlich ist.

formal	 	They catch you with me, you're back in uniform if you're lucky. - They catch me with you, I'll say I'm bringing you in. I get promoted and luck has nothing to do with it. - Fair enough. - Fair enough. - Disposable phone.	Who are you calling?	Wen rufen Sie an?

formal	 	Do you really think that she'll give me safe passage if I make restitution? - If that's what she promised you.

I cheated you.	- Ich rede gerne mal mit ihr. Ich habe Sie betrogen.
formal	 	This cottage is one of the few things that still connects me to the life that I lost the weekend that I met you. - I hand-picked nearly every piece of decor in this place. - And your taste is impeccable, which is exactly why I paid double the asking price-- to make sure it came fully furnished. - I'm contesting the sale. - I was technically on the deed, and in spite of what you stumbled on to between me and Conrad at the Southfork Inn, My ex-husband had no legal right to sell.

formal	 	- Sorry. - - It's okay. - Keep going up. - Just wait, Harry. - McLeod will calm down. Don't show up for a few days.	- You're throwing me out?	- Ihr schmeißt mich raus? - Come on, Harry.
formal	 	Within a few seconds, he was gone again. - I don't know what to say. - You don't have to say anything. - Just listen, because there isn't much time and there's so much more for me to tell you. - I consulted with Dax, and we realized that the accident must have created some sort of subspace link between my father and myself.	That's why he always appeared somewhere near you even if you were hundreds of light years away from where the accident happened.

formal	 	- Well, it's the best way. - - All right, now, no coffee, no smoking, no liquor, no emotional excitement. - Well... - The way you've been abusing yourself, I know you need a lot of milk and cream. - I'll put this in the file, and we'll check on it every week.	Now, I'll go get some milk and cream, you wait here.	Ich hole Milch und Sahne und Sie warten hier.

My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening."	Mein Name ist Stan Shunpike, ich bin heute Abend Ihr Fahrer."
formal	 	- Jessica, no. - You can't make me work with that man. - I can make you work with the goddamn window washers if I want to. - And if you don't do this, you might find yourself dangling 50 stories above the ground. - - Because I asked Jack to make peace, and you're the one he chose to reach out to, so you're the one to do this.	I guess I meant why don't you just fire him?	Ich schätze, ich meine, warum Sie ihn nicht einfach gefeuert haben?
formal	 	Honey, we've got to go. It's a school night. - You know what? Wait. I... - Mr. Monk, I've just got to say something, and I hope you don't think I'm out of line. - But I'm a single parent, and I can tell you it's hard. - I mean, it's wonderful...	It's just I hope you think about what you're doing.	Ich möchte nur, dass Sie wissen, was Sie tun.
formal	 	(loud whirring) - (woman) Bertrand, telephone! - Your insurance agent. - Did you find the owner? - It's not so simple. The car was rented from Midi Car.	As there is no police report, you'd have to sue Midi Car. It's not easy.	Ohne Polizeibericht müssen Sie Midi Car verklagen.
formal	 	You can't think he did it. - He's not the kind of man... - Do you know why they fought that night he ran away? - I didn't know they had a fight. - Thanks.	We'll call you when we need you.	Wir melden uns bei Ihnen, wenn wir Sie wieder brauchen.

formal	 	So tell me, Sheridan... do you ever get used to it? - - Used to what? - - Being dead. - I wasn't dead very long, but... - Well, just long enough to know I didn't like it.	You know, I have been dead many times before.	Wissen Sie, ich bin schon oft tot gewesen.
formal	 	Now, we have two other researchers that were discovered unconscious, but they're both alive over at the med center. - Did they collapse here in the lab? - No, ma'am. - Uh, Harold Coogan, 26, passed out while playing frisbee in the quad outside. And Evan Fenster, 27, passed out while driving. - He blew through a crosswalk without taking anyone else down -- thank God.	I'm assuming he's the reason you're here.

formal	 	You're right. - I'm probably just being silly. - Sweetie, you have nothing to worry about. - Hey. - Hello.	Who are you?	Wer sind Sie?
formal	 	Am I making myself clear to you people? - Yes, boss. - You want some fast results and no bullshit. - Let me have one Chinese undercover cop and I'll penetrate these fuckers. - What are you talking about?	Have you asked your commanding officer?	Haben Sie das schon beantragt?
formal	 	But, if you are doing this, you must have your reasons. - Thanks, Catherine. - Give her my love. - Of course. - Goodbye.	Mrs. Carlier, you swear to tell the truth, and nothing but the truth, by God?	Schwören Sie die Wahrheit zu sagen und nichts als die Wahrheit?

Would you come with us, please?	Kommen Sie bitte mit uns?
formal	 	I couldn't save Quell, I couldn't save Moorhouse. - There was a good chance that she'd die too. - At which point, I would have just... ..moved onto the next... ..and the next... until I beat it. - Sometimes, the only choices you have are bad ones. - But you still have to choose.	It's quite a vehicle you have here, Doctor.	Da haben Sie ein ganz schönes Vehikel, Doctor.

formal	 	Tell them to get me the greatest comedian in the world. - That's flattering, but I can think of greater comedians than myself. - For instance, there's, uh... - There's, um... - Oh, uh...

formal	 	It's about two star-crossed lovers kept apart by a big feud. - No one knows how this feud started, but it's all quite entertaining. - Unfortunately, before we begin, there is a rather long, boring prologue, which I will read to you now. - "Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, - From forth the fatal loins of these two foes..."	Ah, Miss Montague, out you come to ruin my day.	Ach, Miss Montague, Sie wollen meinen Tag ruinieren.
