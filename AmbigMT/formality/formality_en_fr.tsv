neutral	 	I promise you you'll be winners. - Ready? - M-U-S... A! - A-N-G-S! - Mustangs!	You don't know how to spell "Mustangs"?	Comment on йcrit "Mustangs" ?
neutral	 	Cut! - With the guys in 2002, all of a sudden snowboarders are our heroes. - And they're hopeful for getting more gold medals at the Olympics for years to come. - It's kind of turned down the volume on my program a little bit. - The conditions are tough, and I jacked myself a little bit.	When you throw down and kill one, a really sweet line, it's an awesome feeling, you know.	Quand on fait une bonne descente... c'est une sensation formidable.
neutral	 	- She moved in with him. - How did you find out? - I followed her. - Stood outside the building. - - That's so humiliating! - - Tell me about it.	And, you know, I knew. I knew that even though we were happy, it was an illusion.	Mais je savais que même si on était heureux, c'était une illusion.
neutral	 	Got a new angle. Just thought of it. - It's great. - I'll take cowboys. - - Cowboys? What for? - - To lasso lions, of course.	Maxie, you can buy all the lions you want in California.	Maxie, on peut acheter des lions en Californie.
neutral	 	That's what I do when I want to blow off some steam, okay? - So... uh... what got you all steamed up? - You can talk to me. - I mean, come on, you were there when I found out my parents were all messed up, so you can definitely trust me. - My dad meant a lot to me when I was a kid.	And, um, we were, like, really close, and we went sailing, you know?	Et on était vraiment proches, et on allait naviguer.
neutral	 	Look, man, she got out and I offered her a job, all right? - She got desperate and took it. - You stay here until we check out your story. - Can I get a soda or something while I wait? - No.	You know, according to the signal from the tower, a call from the brothel went to a cell phone in this area, so we're gonna split up and see if we can find it.	Bon, d'après le signal émis du relais, l'appel à la maison close a été passé d'une cabine dans cette zone, alors, on va se séparer et voir si on la trouve.
neutral	 	Look at what they did to us, Mr. Shue. - Just like these purple pianos, they ripped out our guts, threw crap all over us and burned us up. - We got hit pretty hard. - But these pianos are still making music. - And so are we.	Mr. Shue, as always, you and I are on the exact same page.	Comme toujours, on est sur la même longueur d'onde.
neutral	 	Sorry about that, everybody. Sorry. - Hello. - Do carry on. - All right, everybody exit in an orderly... All right, single file! Keep it... - I seem to do a lot of falling and screaming in this adventure.	To find something, anything a great truth, or a lost pair of glasses you must first believe there will be some advantage in finding it.	Quand on cherche quelque chose, quoi que ce soit, une vérité essentielle ou une paire de lunettes égarée, il faut être convaincu de l'avantage à la trouver.
neutral	 	I don't know. - I was out of rehab by the time I was six months old. - So... - -What's the deal? Are you gay? - -What?	I don't know. I get this feeling from you, like you're not interested in guys.	Je sais pas, on dirait que t'es pas intéressée par les mecs.
neutral	 	Wheels and the Legman, private eyes! - And we have the best idea for your next book. - Look at him! - He loves it! - That's just another cardboard cutout.	Ah, right, when people talk, you don't see their words.	C'est vrai, quand les gens parlent, on voit pas les mots.
neutral	 	If you could scan the notes we had from the meeting last week and e-mail them to my assistant, that would be great. - Okay. I'll get right on that, Ms. Ramos. - Please don't cc anyone on that. - Thank you. - Last few weeks, you've barely looked at me, Elena.	You and I are gonna be working together every day now.	Toi et moi on va travailler ensemble tout les jours maintenant.
neutral	 	Our aeroplanes are public aeroplanes. - This is an independent sovereign State. At war. - I know nothing about any old order. - I am the Chief here, and I am not taking any orders - old or new, from you. - - I suppose I've walked into trouble.	- Yeah, you can take that as right.	- Oui, on peut dire cela.
neutral	 	- You need to stop what you're doing immediately. - - Why? Harrington's attorney got the knife evidence revoked. - That's impossible. - How? Our warrant encompassed his legal residence, which technically, is his house in Florida. - (Scoffs) We never had a right to enter the house, so anything found on our search is inadmissible.	Apparently, the richer you are, the more justice you can afford.	Plus on est riche, plus on peut se payer de justice.
neutral	 	- Does he suspect? - In Graystone's world, people will do just about anything for money. You live very rustically... Don't you? - Well, I suppose if you like it that way. This girl, Lacy Rand, she was sent to us by Clarice Willow. - Said girl exerts unexplained control over war machines we bought on the black market. - - This is troubling.	- Only if you try to explain it.	Seulement si on tente de l'expliquer.
neutral	 	- Yes, really. I mean it. - Can you ever be more truly alone than when you're in a crowd of people? - Here we sit in this shell a bit of tin and glass - Out there is a whole other world. - Nobody sees us, nobody hears us, nobody bothers us.	Sybille, I imagine that's how it is when you know you're happy.	Sybille, je crois que c'est comme ca quand on sait qu'on est heureux.
neutral	 	- And will you? - - Yes. - In some obscure way... - Querelle understood that love is voluntary. - You have to want it.	When you don't love men... letting yourself get fucked can give you pleasure... but to fuck men, you have to love them... even if only at the moment you're fucking.	Quand on n'aime pas les hommes... on peut avoir du plaisir en se laissant baiser... mais pour les baiser, il faut les aimer... ne serait-ce qu'au moment où on les baise.
neutral	 	You forbid it? - What? Who are you? - Julius Caesar? - Who the hell is Julius Caesar? - You know I don't follow the NBA.	Look, I am so sorry that this happened, Ron, but you and I, we're partners, sweetheart.	Je suis désolée de ce qui t'est arrivé, mais toi et moi, on est partenaires.
neutral	 	That's not true, Philly. - Maybe it's 'cause you don't think you have anything to lose anymore, you know? - You're already locked up. - You... you know, maybe you, um... maybe you like it here. - I mean, I don't know.	But, what I do know is that, if Fibonacci testifies next month, you and I are gonna be neighbors.	Mais ce que je sais, c'est que si Fibonacci témoigne le mois prochain, on va être voisins tous les deux.
neutral	 	Stick to your diet, you fat tub of crap. - Now, that's clever. - Well, Bean, you got any other problems with our act? - Let's see, you got me dressed up like black Chucky, you're doing jokes so bad, even Carlos Mencia wouldn't steal them, and according to your breath, you just ate a tuna sandwich with extra fart sauce. - They're so funny.	You can't even see his lips move.	- On voit même pas ses lèvres bouger.
neutral	 	What an ingrate. - Maybe I should be punished. - You're not giving me a hard time, but you didn't answer my question. - Why am I with Ford? - I don't know.	You answer a question like that rationally... it never sounds true, even if you're not lying.	On répond à une question de façon rationnelle, et on a l'air de mentir, même si on dit la vérité.
neutral	 	Then what is it? - I don't know. - I think I'm just... - I-I just, I just don't want to be - Professor Proton anymore.	Well, how can you say that?	Et bien, comment peut on dire ça?
neutral	 	What kind of trouble are you in? - My mom got sick after she lost her job. - So I borrowed some money off the street to try and help her keep the house. - It wasn't enough, so the bank foreclosed on her a week before she died. - You got a good heart, Cam, but you gotta be careful.	The farther you go down the wrong road, the harder it gets to find your way back.	Plus on avance sur le mauvais chemin, plus il est difficile de faire marche arrière.
neutral	 	Well, I can't think what the Daleks need with me, I'm nothing to them. - You could be... - Whatever's inside that Ark is waking up. I've seen this happen before. - 'First time I saw a Dalek, it was broken, 'it was dying. - 'But I touched it. The moment I did that, I brought it back to life. '	The Doctor said when you travel in time in the Tardis, you soak up all this... background radiation.	Le Docteur m'a dit qu'en voyageant dans le temps avec le Tardis, on absorbait... une radiation de second plan.
neutral	 	Everything off the books lives like Anne Frank now. - Seems like a lot of trouble. - You get too comfortable, people take advantage. - You got it under control? - Don't go looking for miracles, Claudette.	You and me, we figured out how to do time.	Toi et moi, on sait comment faire notre temps.
neutral	 	But he's so sweet. - Ever meet somebody and know you belong together? - It feels- - - Comfortable. - - Comfortable.	- You read the same science journals.	- On lit les mêmes revues.
neutral	 	That's right, Robbie. - You have to let it out. - -Let what out? - -Your feelings. - About what that lousy bitch did to you today.	Don't call her that... because we're going to get back together... and then there will be weirdness between you and me... so just watch it.	L'appelle pas comme ça On va se remettre ensemble... et après on sera mal à l'aise.
neutral	 	A little disagreement. - - Yeah, wild guess-- the Mikes? - - Luckily it was a-- It was a fair fight, mostly. - Yeah, you're a real terror. - Probably shot yourself.	Listen, I told you when you were inside Not to get mixed up with them.	Écoute... quand on était en prison, je t'ai dit de ne pas avoir à faire à eux.
neutral	 	Guess we'll have to add a little bit of weight. - God, you are such a jerk. - How do you sleep at night? - I sleep pretty good. - No wonder your wife left you.	Hey, babe, we can stop this train anytime you want.	Hey, bébé, on peut arrêter à tout moment.
neutral	 	Watch your step. - Be careful, there's a big hole here. - Stay close to the wall. - This is like an obstacle course, huh? - It's like a maze.	It can get really confusing in here, but you get used to it.	On peut vraiment se perdre ici, mais on s'y fait vite.
neutral	 	I'm Big Charlie Lookey. - Oh, I am pleased to meet you. - And I'm pleased to meet you. - Please. - You must not do this.	Oh, baby, you and me are gonna get along great.	Bébé, toi et moi, on va bien s'entendre.
neutral	 	Strap in for me. - OK. - [exhales] May I keep stalking you? - Good-bye, Conor. - Look, just tell me how long... [sighs] All right.	Look, I'll call you tomorrow, and we'll... talk through the... logistics.	D'accord, je t'appelle demain et on parle des questions pratiques.
neutral	 	Every big sport has a lot of communication and PR activity behind it. - He was just burned out. It ate away at him inside. - PR appearances, interviews and he took it all so personally. - And I said to him, "Case, just treat it as a job." - STONER: I know it's a job. At the same time you're going out there, risking every day, you gotta have passion in it.	When you lose that, it's hard to find the motivation to keep going out there and doing the same things.	Quand on perd ça, c'est dur de rester motivé. On n'a plus envie d'aller faire ce genre de choses.
neutral	 	- Yes, I know. - She chose me from a hundred men ready to kill for her. - We were both sure that our relation was perfect, but there was something missing. - You know, love requires such a perfect balance. - It's like the human body.	It may turn out that you have all the vitamins and minerals, but if there is a single, tiny ingredient missing, like, like... ...salt, for example... one dies.	Il peut s'avérer... qu'on a absolument toutes les vitamines et les minéraux, mais si jamais il y a un seul petit ingrédient qui manque, comme... le sel, par exemple... on en meurt.
neutral	 	Seriously? - That would be amazing. - What kind of job? - When you grow up in a city as big as Miami, it's easy to feel small. - Past all those skyscrapers and palm trees is my neighborhood, just a few miles from South Beach, but a world away.	And growing up in a place like this, you learn pretty quick that you have to speak louder than everyone else if you want to be heard.	Et quand on grandit dans un tel lieu, on apprend vite qu'il faut parler plus fort que tous les autres pour être entendu.
neutral	 	She's with Cuervo Jones. - You want to go to Cuervo's place? - - I've been there once. - - Show me. - All right.	I always heard about you, like they couldn't catch you no matter what you did.	J'ai souvent entendu parler de toi. On disait qu'on t'attraperait jamais.
neutral	 	- That's a buck apiece, guys. - Kenneth, this is your big idea. Why don't you pay for this? - Oh! - So do you work as hard off the field as you do on? - Well, uh, I did letter in three indoor sports.	What a wonderful group of young adults we have this year.	Quel merveilleux groupe de jeunes adultes on a cette année.
neutral	 	Are we in a fucking kibbutz? - Yeah, I'll, uh, I'll come back. - Look, are you OK? - I was a house officer at the Whittington in London. - I had a boyfriend, a goldfish, a flat with a garden.	When it was someone's birthday at work, we'd have wine in mugs and eat Twix fingers and you know what? It was lovely.	Pour les anniversaires, au boulot, on buvait du vin dans des tasses, on mangeait des Twix et c'était très sympa.
neutral	 	All things being equal, it wouldn't have been the worst thing in the world - - if I had-- - Forget it. I just wanted you to know the details I do remember, I remember clearly. - Fabulous. - Look, just keep your mouth shut.	You tell anyone else about this, we are D.O.A.	Si quelqu'un l'apprend, on est morts.
neutral	 	I don't believe in it, so why should I do it? - You don't have to believe. - Communion is flesh and blood, bread and whine. - It works no matter what. - Why didn't you mention it earlier? I'll tell them you can't come.	At normal workplaces you go home when your child is ill.	- Non ! Pour tout autre boulot, on peut rentrer chez soi quand son enfant est malade.
neutral	 	And since his wife's expressed a romantic interest in you... - We need you to exploit it. - Oh, exploit it. - Gotcha. - Yeah. Textbook CIA.	Look, Casey and I will be with you every step of the way.	Ecoute, Casey et moi on sera avec toi à chaque étape.
neutral	 	But you didn't think it through. - Sometimes heroes come to tragic ends. - What's the matter? - A little short of breath? - What a terrible way to die.	Especially when you're so claustrophobic.	Surtout quand on est si claustrophobe.
neutral	 	But why Frieda, though? - Maria seems much nicer to me. Since one can hardly tell the difference between them... Oh, I can! - Maria is very nice, probably much nicer than Frieda, but Frieda has a kind of fire inside her. - I can almost feel it burning when I'm near to her. - And she has a strange, mysterious quality.	Maria is like an open book, while with Frieda one feels you could go on learning about her forever.	Maria est comme un livre ouvert, alors qu'avec frieda, on apprend chaque jour.
neutral	 	You know what, he's also always wrong. - We secure here? - Just have to finish up in the basement. - Then do it. - That's great, just great.	Sure, Riley, we need you on site.	Bien sûr Riley, on a besoin de toi ici.
neutral	 	Somebody build a fire. - Start up some coffee. - Can't we go on? Just you and me? - - Be like lookin' for a needle in a haystack. - - Yeah, but I'm worried about Emma.	Suppose we were lucky enough to stumble across 'em. You don't think they'd give up without a fight?	Et si on tombait sur eux par hasard, ils se rendraient sans se battre ?
neutral	 	Now you show up, which means I owe her 20 bucks. - Nancy Temple, 39, complaining of nausea and dizziness since waking today. - Then she threw up. - Twice. - [Nancy] Kelly said I had to go to the doctor.	At school, you have to if you vomit.	À l'école, on est obligés si on vomit.
neutral	 	She left her purse. - It's all in here. - Her cell phone. - Where are you? - - Her battery gave out.	- We're going to find you!	- On va te trouver!
neutral	 	You hate me. - Thanks. - And I don't hate you. - Yeah, you do. - What are you doing here?	I have to talk to you.	- On doit parler.
neutral	 	I had a great idea. - You know how we're always having to stop and solve differential equations like when you do Fourier analysis or using the Schrodinger equation? - Howard doesn't. - He's only an engineer. - I think we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine.	You just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation, and bam!	Avec un smartphone, on prend l'équation en photo et bam !
neutral	 	Now I'm gonna tell you my whole plan ... and then I'm gonna come up with some absurd, convoluted way to kill you... and then you'll find an equally comnvoluted way to escape. - That sounds good to me. - Well, this ain't that kind of movie. - No - Is he dead?	That's usually what happens when you shoot someone in the head.	C'est souvent ce qu'il se passe quand on tire dans la tête de quelqu'un.
neutral	 	Thank you, Russ. - My cousin-in-law, whose heart is bigger than his brain... - I appreciate that. - ...is innocent. - I'll be more than happy to take the rap on this on behalf of myself and every other employee you rear-ended this Christmas.	Sometimes things look good on paper, but lose their luster when you see how it affects real folks.	Parfois les choses paraissent bien sur le papier... mais perdent leur attrait quand on voit combien ça affecte les gens.
neutral	 	Now, don't worry. You'll die slow. - I wanna feel every delicious moment of your pain. - Come! - [ Gabrielle ] Xena. - Alti just left.	If we're gonna bring her back to the past and beat her, you'd better start painting.	Si on veut la ramener, commence à peindre.
neutral	 	It's her. - You think I don't know my own wife? - Charley. - All right, babe. - I need you to pay attention right now. okay?	The first night you and I ever made love,	La première fois où on a fait l'amour, où était-ce ?
neutral	 	You know, we missed a lot of good stuff the day after Christmas. - Been a hell of a week, hasn't it? - Life is a pain in the ass. I'll tell ya. - You work hard, try to provide for the family, and then, for one minute, everything's good. - Everyone's well. Everyone's happy.	In that one minute, you have peace.	L'espace de cet instant-là, on a la paix.
neutral	 	Hi. - I'm Melanie. - I'm gonna be leasing the place. - I've been the caretaker of this house for 50 years, but you can kick me out. - - Oh, no worries.	If you can escape from the Nazis, you can handle anything.	- Pas de problème. Quand on peut échapper aux nazis, on peut tout supporter.
neutral	 	well, partly because this building is an architectural gem and deserves to be landmarked. - partly because people do need a place to do senior's water ballet and CPR. - preferably not together. - But mainly because this person, despite being unusually stubborn and unwilling to compromise and a very poor dresser, is.... - She's rather like the building she loves so much.	A little rough around the edges, but when you look closely absolutely beautiful.	Un peu rêche en apparence, mais quand on regarde de plus près... absolument magnifique.
neutral	 	Them's her children. - She's got four children? - Now, son, I didn't claim they was her natural-born children. - Their own precious mother, precious woman passed away July the 4th, Independence Day, 1955, the year of the drought. - When I married Lula Mae, she was going on 14.	Now, you might think the average person going on 14 wouldn't know his own mind.	On pourrait croire qu'à 14 ans, on ne sait pas ce qu'on veut.
neutral	 	Luckless guesses it's safe to come out and it dawns on him that he doesn't know the way home. - All night long, Mother keeps a vigil for her little lost one. - He's never slept alone, and in the middle of the night some big animals come sniffing around. - He tries to lie very still and pretend he's only a stone but he's very frightened. - When a baby wart hog gets separated from its mother, it'll try to find a substitute.	It's not easy to get yourself adopted when you have a face that only your mother can love.	Mais ce n'est pas facile de se faire adopter... quand on a un visage que seule une mère peut aimer.
neutral	 	What's to stop progress nowadays? - War! - Firstly, there isn't going to be a war, and secondly, war doesn't stop progress. - It stimulates progress. - Yes, war can be a highly stimulating thing.	But you can overdo a stimulant.	Mais on peut abuser des stimulants.
neutral	 	We'll let you know when we're ready down here. - We'll set off the charges at the same time. -Out. - Well, we got our hands full. - We can't plug these up quick enough for me. - Well, we got three holes to blow.	You think we got enough dynamite?	- On aura assez de dynamite ?
neutral	 	There's plenty more where that came from. - Look, I was just googling record lengths of stuff, and apparently there's a guinness world record for the biggest pillow... or blanket fort. - So you boys... - you should go for it. - Put this school on the map.	We'd have a better chance of setting the record if we made this a blanket fort, you know, take less time.	On a plus de chances de battre le record si on fait un fort en couvertures, ça prend moins de temps
neutral	 	And how you gonna do that? - We're breaking out of here. - How? - - It starts in our cell. - - In our cell?	To tell you the truth, it's already started.	A dire vrai, on a déjà commencé.
neutral	 	What are you doing? - Making sure the room is airtight, my friend. - What are you doing? - You must be insane. - No, no, no, Mr. Hagar, let it burn.	But you've got to put it out or we'll all suffocate...	Mais il faut l'éteindre, on va suffoquer.
neutral	 	You broke my blender. Yeah. - Well, I was trying to make gravel and it just... - It just didn't work out. - Why were you making gravel?	Well, I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.	Ça crisse quand on marche dessus.
neutral	 	Actually, I'd like to hear more about Mama's wild oats. - If your uncle values his life, you never will. - You and Mom seemed to have a pretty good system for raising us up, Dad. - Well, it wasn't really a system. - We just believed in letting you all live your own lives.	For the most part, and... if you look around the table, it turned out pretty well.	Pour le principal et... quand on regarde autour de cette table, ça a plutôt bien marché.
neutral	 	You know,like,uh,you and michael. - Well,look,I-I know you're all busted up about cassie,but chompin' pills? - That's kiddie hopper shit. - Okay... it's very important to me that you straighten your shit out. - Understand?	You and me,we got a little bond.	Toi et moi on a un petit secret.
neutral	 	It's the fourth gym suit you lost. - Why do you think that happens, Marit? - Because I have a job, right? I'm trying to make money, so we can afford to buy a gym suit. - Now you take these and buy as much gym suits you have a new set for each fucking gymnastics lesson in his life. - Have a nice day.	I've talked with my lawyer and we propose a new scheme in which he stays ten days with me and four with you.	J'ai parlé à mon avocat. On préfèrerait 10 jours chez moi, 4 chez toi.
neutral	 	The minister's getting into his clothes. - Let me be the first to congratulate you. - If I knew how to pray, I would. - The mountains are very beautiful. - There are steep valleys in there that take your breath away.	Places where it seems like if you knew the right words, you could talk to God.	Des endroits où, si on avait les mots, on pourrait parler à Dieu.
neutral	 	What's wrong, Koino? - Mon honey. - What happened? - Huh? Your face. - This?	I started working at a bar, a weird place you can read manga.	J'ai trouvé du travail dans un bar, un endroit bizarre où on lit des mangas.
neutral	 	Right. Okay? - What the hell do you think you're doing? - I'm just following the doctor's orders. - I cannot believe this is happening. - Try being me.	I mean, you meet someone in a bar, you have a few drinks, a few laughs, you make out in the car.	On se rencontre dans un bar, on boit un peu, on rit, - on se pelote dans la voiture...
neutral	 	I don't know what the hell you think you're doing to yourself, Tim. - You're completely dehydrated, your body went into shock, and whose wouldn't? - I don't understand what you're trying to do to yourself. - The front desk can't get a hold of Billy to come down and pick you up. - Yeah, he's probably screwing my ex-girlfriend.	And we can't release you without an adult signature.	Et on peut pas te laisser partir sans la signature d'un adulte.
neutral	 	You're gonna get it, Mr. Boston Globe All-Star. - Two-time, actually. - Yeah. - You always get everything. - Congratulations, Sean.	Oh, you never know, Gerard.	Oh, on sait jamais, Gerard.
neutral	 	All right fellows, get your gears together. - Jake, Killer, Super Jack, Diesel. - Assholes in our polls, gentlemen. - Let's go. - Toby!	You deal with these guys, we're gonna need some serious gear.	Pour s'occuper de ces types, on va avoir besoin de matos.
neutral	 	It's happening again! - What are you talking about? - My sexsomnia. - Your what? - Yeah, it's like sleepwalking, except...	Instead of using your legs, you use your... you know.	Mais au lieu d'utiliser ses jambes, on utilise son...
neutral	 	You... you mean... you mean me? - Your way is gonna destroy this place. - It's gonna get people killed. - It's already gotten people killed. - And i'm not gonna stand by and just let it happen.	If you don't fight, you die.	Si on ne se bat pas, on meurt.
neutral	 	Sounds good? - It's because I'm the best guitar player in the world. - Self-taught. - No lessons, thank you very much, Pop. - They'll be divorced in a year. Very good.	I think we all know that when you fall in love... the emptiness kind of drifts away.	Nous savons tous que quand on tombe amoureux, c'est comme si sa vie n'était plus vide.
neutral	 	Oh, my God! - You just got out! - I'm sorry. - Well, I guess we're even. - Wait a minute.	Michael, you don't offer a woman money if it's been nice.	On n'offre pas d'argent à une femme si on a pris son pied.
neutral	 	- Sit down, Mr. Dodsworth. - You do need soothing. - I've been having such a good time on this trip. - Everybody's so nice. - There's nothing like a first trip to Europe.	Especially when you're old enough to know what you're after.	Surtout quand on est assez vieux pour savoir ce qu'on cherche.
neutral	 	That's the purest style and that's the style that Joe and I had climbed Siula Grande. - It's a very committing way of climbing, because you have no line of retreat. - If something goes wrong, it can be very very serious. - There's no rescue, there's no helicopter rescue and there's no other people. - There's no margin for error.	If you get badly hurt, you'I probably die.	Si on est gravement blessé, on en meurt.
neutral	 	- I am so pissed at this company. - And Jim. - Who said that? - I think it was Creed. - It's going really well, actually.	Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise, we each got 24 beans, so the idea is you place the bean on the picture of who you think deserv...	Chaque haricot représente 0,5 % d'augmentation, on a 24 haricots, donc on place un haricot sur la photo de celui qui, selon nous, mérite...
neutral	 	Knock, knock. - Hi. We're just here to drop off the newspaper bag. - You're the folks whose kid is quitting the route. - Yeah. I'm so sorry. - You got our e-mail?	Oh, sure, sure. 'Course, in my day, when you quit a job, you looked a man in the eye and told him you were quitting.	À mon époque, quand on démissionnait, on venait le dire en personne.
neutral	 	No, I understand. - It's either in your heart or it isn't. - It's in your heart, sir? - I was boxing pro at 17, Bud. - Winning too.	You know, when you hit a bloke properly it's like it strikes a chime in your viscera.	Quand on frappe juste, c'est comme un carillon dans les tripes.
neutral	 	Sarah, darling, this business has all been too much for you. - I'm taking you back to the country with me. - It's no good saying no, because I've made up my mind. - Now, let's see. - Yes.	If you pack quickly, we can catch the next train.	Si on se dépêche, on peut attraper le prochain train.

neutral	 	Your mind always got to be working, and that's how you learn tricks. - That's how you progress the sport. That's everything. - Your mind's gotta be open. - I think the next level in snowboarding is starting to happen now. - I mean, all of us have learned all these freestyle tricks.	So, we're all starting to take that into the backcountry where the elements are unpredictable, and you can't necessarily see over the next thing where you're gonna land.

If you dress an elephant as a man, it would still make it into Bolivia.	Que si on déguisait un éléphant en homme, il arriverait aussi en Bolivie.
neutral	 	It's "the Cuban sandwich." - Nate, we're on our way to the courthouse. - Check it out. - The cop aliases I created are so foolproof, I was able to get an official squad car from the Boston P.D. - 8017, baby.	Maybe next time, you can get us a fire truck.	La prochaine fois on aura un camion de pompiers ?
neutral	 	Oh, look everybody. - Sunshine's awake! Ronaldo! - Even on a flesh wound. Ow, ow, ow, ow! - That must hurt. - Sorry.	Now that we're all here, and so happy, do you think we could all get along for three microts?	Nous voilà tous enfin réunis dans la joie et la bonne humeur si on essayait de s'entendre pendant trois microts ?
neutral	 	Why don't you move out and find a new roommate? - Yeah. - Turn around. ♪ Should I give up ♪ - ♪ Or should I just keep chasing pavements? - ♪ ♪ Even if it leads nowhere. ♪	Now if we're talking anaerobic exercises, that's a completely different story, because you're actually using your own body weight, which is an extremely efficient form of strength training.	Si on parle d'exercices d'anaérobie, c'est pas pareil. On utilise le poids du corps, c'est super efficace pour se muscler.

Fine. - Saw your dad in the parking lot. - He's awaiting for me to ask Amy if she'd like to get something to eat. - I don't think there's anything wrong with that. - Dad, it's totally fine.

neutral	 	I know it's real. - OK. - This is the real one, definitely this one. - It's all solid. - It felt solid in the TARDIS too.	You can't spot a dream while you're having it.	On peut pas différencier un rêve quand on le fait.
neutral	 	Klara! - Klara! - Where is klara? - Grandpa is right. - You come in like a savage.	Not even a good day". It is no wonder. We know who made you a savage.	Ca ne m'étonne plus, quand on sait qui t'a rendu ainsi.

You hang up the phone in front of Mr Teodoresco. - You hang up the phone in front of him? - Hey, dickhead, do you see my pals over there? - You see them?	Dickhead, we're going to set you on fire.	P'tit couillon, on va te foutre le feu.

neutral	 	And five of them: Da-da da-da da-da da-da da-da. Make a pentameter line, five iambs. - An lamb is like an anteater. - Very high in the back and very short, little front legs. Da-da! - Shakespeare's poetry and his iambics floated and descended through the pentameter of the soul. - And it's the soul, the spirit of real, concrete people going through hell and sometimes moments of great achievement and joy.	That is the pentameter you must focus on and should you find that reality all the iambics will fall into place.	C'est sur ce pentamètre qu'il faut se concentrer et si on trouve cette réalité, tous les iambes se mettent en place.

I want to date and have sex outside of a committed relationship. - You mean like any other 16-year-old guy that doesn't have a girlfriend with a baby. - I love John. - He's great.	I know sometimes in life, you'd rather ignore a challenge than deal with it.	Parfois dans la vie, on préfère ignorer un problème que de le gérer.
neutral	 	Do it! - Come on! - - [Screams] - Come on! - Second time, Ernesto. - You're looking at life.	But we can say that Pulpo came in, threatened you, and forced you to help them out.	Mais on peut dire que Pulpo est venu, t'as menacé, et obligé à les aider.
neutral	 	Trust me. - - Really? - No. - Not really. - You wanna talk about it? - As your designated wedding sex, everything you say is privileged.	No, I just...

neutral	 	- I say yes. - I'm not even sure if I'm available. - - He's good. - - No! - No! He's weird.	You know, we might be able to work up to that. But right now, we've only got $83.	On trouvera sûrement l'argent, mais pour l'instant, on n'a que 83 $ .

I don't remember anything. - - Get out of my locker room.	- l told you guys to invite him.	- On aurait dû l'inviter aussi.
neutral	 	Some business deal? - Well, yes and no. - He's a writer living in Paris. - I'd like to live in Paris. - Me too.	Of course, a fellow would have to watch his step, but... I'll bet it'd be a lot of fun once you got to know the place.	Bien sûr, il faut faire attention quand on marche, mais... je parie que c'est très amusant une fois qu'on connaît la place.

We're not used to guests. - That's what I was about to say. - But now you mention it, I happen to quite like the women of the outback. - But they're mostly native women. - Aboriginal women.	They're very easy to, uh- to get along with, if you try.	C'est très facile de... s'entendre avec elles... si on essaie.
neutral	 	- And Ken in the middle of the night. - - Yeah, Chase too. - What's going on? - - You guys know? - - No.	But if you're trying to get anything out of these storm troopers, you're just wasting your time.	Mais on perd notre temps à essayer de tirer quoi que ce soit de ces soldats d'assaut.
neutral	 	LittleJamie sailing the seas in his cradle boat. - What does he look like? - They say he's grown into a fine little gossoon... sittin' in the stern of his cradle like a captain in his ship. - Always there's creatures about him. - Seals swimming' in the water... great crowd of sea gulls squawking' overhead.	If you call out or try to come closer, he vanishes... in a great splash in the water and wings flapping' like a phantom they say.	Si on appelle ou essaye de s'approcher, il disparaît... dans une grande éclaboussure d'eau et un grand battement d'ailes comme un fantôme, ils disent.

neutral	 	I might. - How come? - 'Cause I think you need taking care of. - - What the fuck is taking you so long? - We've been trying, Nucky. - - It ain't like we haven't asked around.	You're trying to solve a murder, not find a lost cat.	Se renseigner ? On parle d'un meurtre, pas d'un chat égaré.
neutral	 	Look, as people pass by, they ogle - - Whether they wear a jellabah or not... - - That's normal - Why is it normal - I've been cruised quite a lot, since we are here	The guy in the shop, where we were he told me you're an algerian, i said yes	Avant, le mec du magasin, où on était partis Il me fait, toi t'es algérien, je lui dis ouais
neutral	 	Thank you. - Is a heterosexual Marine, by definition, a gay-basher? - Does a dispute between a straight man and gay man automatically indicate homophobia? - Now, if we answer yes, then we have a problem with bigotry. - But the problem lies within ourselves.	Now, if you assumed Petty Officer Tiner was gay, like I did, you assumed wrong.	Si on a supposé que Tiner était gay, comme je l'ai fait, on a eu tort.
neutral	 	Just like that, plop! - Dead! - That's real telepathy for you. - Man is a frail vessel. - It's not telepathy, though.	Whatever it is: when you're warned you must listen.	Quoiqu'il en soit, il faut être attentif quand on a des prémonitions.
neutral	 	Well, I'll tell you what. - Next time, I won't. - Come on, let's go again. - You know this is a stupid-ass game. - Will you just give it a chance?	- You can't do that.	- On peut pas faire ça.

neutral	 	Nice! - It's even nicer when there's no one holding a gun in it. - They got wrestling coming in from Chicago. - I know it's supposed to be fixed, but so is everything else. - Why don't you just take the set?	Yeah, now that all the Westerns have gone psycho, this is the only place left where you can tell for sure who the bad guys are.	Même les westerns sont psychologiques maintenant, c'est le dernier truc où on sait à coup sûr qui sont les méchants.
neutral	 	But a couple of blocks away, we saw this black guy tearing down the street in a hoodie, maybe blue. - We nearly ran over him on Brian's Vespa. - We almost hit this crazy black dude with my bike. - Does that help? - Remember him enough to work with our sketch artist?	Waiting tables, you get a good memory for faces.	Dans mon boulot, on a la mémoire des visages.
neutral	 	What do you say to that, Pretty? - Hmm? - Yeah... - Maybe it's time I lit up that face once and for all. - God, he talks too much.	You and I need to have a conversation.	Toi et moi, on doit avoir une conversation.
neutral	 	Stavanger? - No. I'm from various places. - Mostly from here. - Do you have a family? - I don't want to talk about it.	I grew up with my mother and she died at the time when you don't care that much about your parents.	J'ai grandi avec ma mère. Elle est morte à une époque où on est en conflit avec ses parents.
neutral	 	She would've been able to give me some sign of life. - You can always find time to write. - And she doesn't work Mondays. - We'll be there in 20 minutes. - Thanks.	After lunch we'll get you some new duds.	Après le déjeuner, on ira te resaper à neuf.
neutral	 	I never even wanted to speak to those pizdy! - You made me. - Why did you do such a thing? - Because they left me out! - Because they made fun of me!	Because no matter how hard you try and how much we want it, there's the people who serve the bread, and the people who eat the bread!	Parce que peu importe à quel point on essaie, il y a toujours ceux qui servent le pain et ceux qui mangent le pain.
neutral	 	Did you cool that horse down? - Yes, sir. - I take care of my girl. - Don't I, Flicka? - And where did you ride today?	You know, here and there. Around. We saw a herd of wild mustangs...	Je me suis baladée ici et là On a vu un troupeau de mustangs...
neutral	 	Well, I brought you some apology beers. - But you weren't home, so I drank 'em while I was waiting. - N-No need for apology. - And then I looked over here and saw the lights and thought maybe you came to the party. - And I was hungry.	Look, wh-why don't we just walk you back over to my place?	Et si on retournait chez moi ?
neutral	 	How... - What do you think we've been doing the last 10 years? - Yeah. - It's terrorism, Joe. - Okay?	If you kill an American because of a religious belief, you are a terrorist... and terrorists get locked the fuck up.	Tuer un Américain parce qu'on croit un peu trop en Dieu, c'est du terrorisme... et les terroristes, on les fout en taule.
neutral	 	So what's the verdict, captain? - Little Justin in love? - I don't know. - - She's cute. - - Congratulations for having eyeballs.	What about, you know, going all the way?	Si on allait jusqu'au bout?
neutral	 	You could have taken them! - Dragica, forget the cake, and leave the child alone. - What were you doing when you were his age? - Running off to grandma for the cake? - I'm sorry.	Toni, can zrinka and i count on you?	Tony, on peut compter sur toi ?
neutral	 	Where was Catherine? - Who was she with? - What was she doing? - You know Isbister's got a reputation? - I mean, I fancied 17-year-olds when I was 17.	-But you're supposed to grow out of it.	- On est supposé grandir.
neutral	 	No. - I'm a substitute. - - For what? - - For whatever needs substituting. - Yeah, they'll just plug me in.	I think I'm just gonna wait here until, you know, if they need me in French, then that's where I'll go.	Je vais attendre ici. Si on a besoin de moi en français, j'irai en français.
neutral	 	Different perspective of the Earth. Different perspective of yourself. - Every time's completely different. - It's just... - It's just beautiful, is what it is. - Beautiful.	You see the world, and you realize how small we all are.	On voit le monde, et on se rend compte combien on est petit.
neutral	 	No idea who I was for a good minute, until, uh, in the end, I just had to walk out. - I'm sure that happens to a lot of people. - On the road to senior citizenship. - [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, you are. - On a clear day, I can see the end of my life staring me in the face.	You know, it's fucking bizarre, one day, you turn the corner of your street and everything's changed, but you never saw it happening.	C'est bizarre, un jour on tourne le coin de sa rue et tout a changé. On est complètement surpris.
neutral	 	I could have shagged my way round your mates at the Kings Arms. - I'm sure. - But I didn't. - Because I'm... I'm a human being. - Not a bloody animal.	15... 15 I've been with you since.	15 ans... on est ensemble depuis 15 ans.
neutral	 	Guys, you heard him. We inspired him to better himself. - Still, to be safe, we should follow him... you know, just to see if he's doing all the things he says he is. - And 300. - Have a good one. - Hey, Liz, I'm thinking about going to Nordstrom's at lunch.	You want to grab a sandwich and walk around Nordstrom's at lunch, Elizabeth?	On prend un sandwich et on y fait un tour, Elizabeth ?
neutral	 	- Good night, Yamamoto. - - Damn it. - Dorothy? - I really can't get down! - Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like this dog came with batteries included.	Actually, Jill, we do the interrupted stitch at this hospital, thank you.	En fait, Jill, on fait les sutures par points séparés dans cet hôpital, merci.
neutral	 	Who's in the middle? - Look over here. - All right. - Go dance, drink eggnog. - - Hey, sexy cameraman. - Hey, ladies.	- Connor, we're really worried about you.	- Salut, les filles. - Connor, on est inquiètes pour toi.
neutral	 	Oh, yeah, that's what you do best. You run. - Leaving us with nothing but heartache and a crotch full of stubble burn. - You know what? I don't need any coffee. - I am wide awake. - Bye-bye.	You know, if they'd invent a vibrator that killed spiders and did the cha-cha we wouldn't need any of them.	Si on inventait un vibromasseur qui tue les araignées et danse le cha-cha-cha, on n'aurait pas besoin d'eux.
neutral	 	I'm on team Lily, 'cause, you know, she's you, right? - No, she's not. - I am an adult. - We are all adults. - Chris, Gillian, everybody.	All you need is little Mike, and then you've got the whole movie.	Avec le petit Mike, on a tout le film.

neutral	 	Bodin was probably the first to attempt to establish a system, if the term "system" may be applied to the Middle Ages, for classifying evil. - In Bodin, we find one of the first definitions of the word "witch" - and I quote, "A witch is a person who, - "though cognisant of the laws of God, "endeavours to act through the medium of a pact with the devil." - To assist them in their work, many witches kept familiars, that is to say, creatures such as cats or toads, in which supernatural spirits or demons were thought to reside.	For those of you who wish to delve more deeply into the subject of witchcraft, a great deal of relevant information may be found in the following works.	Pour ceux qui souhaitent approfondir le sujet controversé de la sorcellerie, on peut trouver des informations pertinentes dans...
neutral	 	Mostly for show. - Apology accepted. - You know, we heard Xena travelled with a companion... A storyteller of sorts. - I am. - I mean, I used to tell stories, but it's been a while.	When you're born with a gift of the bard, you die with it.	Quand on naît barde, on l'est pour la vie.

neutral	 	Thank you, Isaac. - I asked you to come over here today because I still have questions about my mother. - If there's anything I can do to put your mind at ease... - I appreciate that, Gene. - Maybe there is.	It's interesting, living in a house where you and your family lived for, what...	C'est intéressant de vivre là où on a vécu avec sa famille, pendant quoi,
neutral	 	Oh! Because of WAC. - The thing is, I don't think I can. It's not even a real thing. - You think you're some kind of special, don't you? - No, I'm serious. - It's a scam.	Which, when you think about it, we really all should've seen coming.	Ce que, quand on y pense, on aurait du voir venir.
neutral	 	Again! - That's enough. - "come home from Iraq," my wife says. - "Fallujah's too dangerous," my wife says. - You beat those stamp nazis with good old-fashioned american complaining.	Homer, if it weren't for you, we'd be at the mercy of weekend philatelists.	Homer, si t'avais pas été là, on serait à la merci des philatélistes du week-end.

neutral	 	Is that all right? - I need to talk about it, man. - I work for this guy now. - I can't... I mean, that's all I'm... It's all I'm thinking about. - I'm gonna tell you this story that makes me feel all right with death.	When I was younger, my grandfather died and we were all gathered around him and there was this one candle next to his bed.	Mon grand-père est mort quand j'étais jeune. On était tous autour de lui, et il y avait une bougie près de son lit.
neutral	 	How's it looking? - Trickled eel with lithinated cream, and juniper in tansy leaf pouches. - Don't congratulate me, I'm just following Gouffé. - For the pleasure of Sir and his guest. - Nicolas, please stop speaking in the third person.	That kind of familiarity comes when you chase girls together.	- La familiarité n'est admissible que si on a couru les filles ensemble.
neutral	 	And would you bring us a bottle of Moët? - Sure. - Sit down, sit down. - - Sounds like good news. - I'd say it is.	In fact, you could call this a celebration dinner.	En fait, on pourrait dire que c'est un souper de célébration.
neutral	 	-You don't need that, baby. - Wait, we can't - We can't - Look, it's just I don't think we should do it.

formal	 	Now, clearly the defense doesn't want you to do that. - In fact, if they stand here and say... - "Hey, we admit that he disregarded the law"... they are preying on your willingness to do the same.

formal	 	No. - And that's what concerns me. - I hate to admit it, but maybe Riley's right. - Right? - Right about what?	You've both told me to look at cyber-renders like a dream...	Vous m'avez tous les deux dit de regarder les rendus virtuels comme un rêve...
formal	 	I'm ready enough to do what I gotta do all by my damn self. - So you can take these and go to the dance yourself. - Progress reports? You're the basketball coach. - Look, ma'am, we talked about this. - I don't see what the problem is.	Do you know what the api is, Mr. Carter?	Savez-vous ce qu'est l'I.P.S. ?
formal	 	My God. - What else did Steve tell you? - He told me you pay him 200 a year, plus fringes. - I'll take 250. - Why should I pay you more than Steve's getting?	Steve didn't give you a hard-on.	Steve ne vous faisait pas bander.
formal	 	When it comes to women, I'm a total shit. - The difference is, I know I'm a shit. - - Nobody knows about the brunette! - - It's our secret. - The part about me being a shit with women ain't going in the book.	- I gotta put your family in my book.	- Il y aura votre famille dans mon livre.

formal	 	_ - _ - _ _ - I am not alone. - Are you in need of assistance, My Lady ?	You should have stayed ... dead !	Vous auriez dû rester chez ... les morts !
formal	 	I just needed some time. - I just wanted to apologize for Dr. Bennett. - She had no right to upset you like that. - Anyway, I... I...
